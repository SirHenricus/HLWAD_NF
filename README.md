# Half Life WAD3 - New Format

This is a conversion of all assets from that the game "Half Life" that are contained in .wad and .spr files converted to more modern formats

### I DO NOT CLAIM OWNERSHIP OVER ANY OF THE ASSETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPOSITORY. ALL OWNERSHIP GOES TO VALVE.

I used SLADE, Wrench Softwareâ€™s Sprite Explore and TexMex to do make this repository

Some folders are left empty as I couldn't find a way to convert the assets, but I left them there in case I do in the future.

This is merely meant as a resource for people to easily find these graphics without having to do all the hard work. I'm sure you could already this on the Spriter's Resource, but I'm just doing this in case you can't or don't feel like it.


WAD3 Textures --> .BMP (with the excpetion of LOGO.png)

SPR Static Sprites --> .BMP

SPR Animated Sprites --> .GIF


This repository contains textures and sprites from Half Life, Team Fortress Classic and Half Life Deathmatch Classic. I plan to include the textures and sprites from the Opposing Force and Blue Shift in the future

#### some of the sprite names may be misspelled as I had to type their names by hand when I had to export them.
